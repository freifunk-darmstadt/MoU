# Freifunk Memorandum of Understanding

After 10 years Freifunk is quite successful, well known and widespread. However we don't see that the original ideas and goal of Freifunk are still taken into consideration by all communities or all community members. Our main concern is not to exclude communities which don't identify themselves with the hereby stated self-understanding. But we are interested in a basic dispute about what we are doing here jointly under the label Freifunk. This draft was written by a group associated with the Förderverein Freie Netzwerke e.V. It is meant to be a basic principle of understanding and intends to encourage all communities to reflect on the stated topics. Why do we engage in Freifunk? Which ideas are behind it? Which goals do we pursuit? According to which principle do we make decisions and take action? It is the goal of this ext, to develop an understanding which connects all individuals and groups who act under the label Freifunk.

## Preamble

Free (wireless) networks are build and provided by many local initiatives. The users are simultaneously operators of the computer networks. They create "do it yourself" network by self-reliantly connecting apartments, houses, streets of houses, districts, villages or whole cities. A Freifunk-network is built in a decentralized way and is operated by many individuals. This decentralized structure of organization promotes deliberately local activities instead of wanting to be governed by a higher entity. "Frei" (free) stands for making these networks open and anonymously accessible, they are to be operated in a non-commercial way, are not analyzed and the thereby contained information is not to be inspected, modified or censored. Although Freifunk refers primarily to WLAN-networks, the term "freie Netzwerke" should be taken into a broader context. It is oriented among others by the freenetworks.org definition. Despite all decentralization we reasonable and important to come to a common understanding on the basic principles of the undertaking Freifunk, in order to act jointly and support each other in our activities.

## Goals of Freifunk

The use of technical networks has become a everyday occurrence long ago, nevertheless the underlying power and action mechanism are often not being reflected on sufficiently. Freifunk has set one of its goal to be the creation of an awareness of these contexts in the broader society and to promote the free and open access to give impulses for a self-determined actions. Thereby we would like to include the needs of distinct societal groups. We consider diversity and a broad spectrum of ideas to be an important foundation to reach these goals. We would like to encourage all participants to take matters in their own hands and support them to get familiarized with the subject matter. We are aware of the fact that this is an elaborate learning process. However we would like to avoid the continuation of knowledge-hierarchies by the desire of participant to be merely supplied. According to our view this leads to the erosion of the basic idea of a "do it yourself" network. Being Freifunkers we participate in the political process getting the judicial preconditions for free networks. Hereby the Freifunk movement is above party lines.

## Principles of Freifunk

It is our wish to have the social community-building and the technical implementation of free networks in the communities according to similar principles: decentralized, with as few and as shallow hierarchies as possible, yet with a common agreements.
Many of our principles have already been formulated elsewhere. As Freifunkers we commit to the following already existing documents:

* Pico Peering Agreement
* Our Vision:
* Free Culture Definition
* Community Wireless Definition
* free networks definition
* secrecy of telecommunications (GG Art. 10,1)
* pinciple of Datensparsamkeit (data scarsity) and Datenvermeidung (data avoidance) (BDSG § 3a
* We do not log!
* The hacker ethics of the Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) is transferable to free networks.
* The declaration of the incompatibility of the CCC “acknowledge color against fascism”  , especially the paragraph “Die Erklärung”

### Technical principles

The Pico Peering Agreement is the basis of our networks. For us the following pillars constitute a free network:

* Our nodes build a mesh-network among on another. When talking about freifunk-network we refer to this mesh network, which is being created between the routers. It ends where the internet begins, that is where a router routes the data traffic into the internet. And it ends where the private home-network begins.
* We design our networks to be open and public: everybody can operate a node and thereby extend the network.
* Our network is accessible anonymously, neither users nor node operators should register to participate.
* Our network is non-commercial.
* Nobody censors in our network.
* We abide by the secrecy of telecommunications law.
* Privacy protection and data scarsity: We log neither connection nor inventory data. We do not save person related data. The disclosure of email-addresses for the purpose of making contact as well as coordinates on the map are optional.
* Users are themselves responsible for end-to-end encryption and anonymizing their traffic.

When designing our networks we pay attention to decentrality. Therefore a small admin group or individual persons having control over a whole (sub)network does not reflect our thinking. Node operators have the to make the decision whether to chose remote maintenance. Interventions on the nodes, for example firmware upgrades or other remote administration work have always been done with explicit agreement of the respective operators. Node operators can furthermore decide weather they would like to provide internet access, be it for the participants of the mesh network or for the public. Hereby it is important that Freifunk is not to be perceived as "provider for gratis internet access". Decisions about releases in the local communities are made jointly. The firmware for our nodes is based on free software. We publish further developments likewise as FLOSS. Having a best possible documentation the operator should be enabled to extend the firmware themselves or give suggestions for improvements. Openness creates confidence in the software.

### Social principles

A pleasant social climate is important for our communities. 
With Freifunk we would like to achieve that people participate actively and feel well independent of gender, sexual orientation, origin, believe, looks, age and further (factual or attributed) traits. The social interaction should be respectful; newly interested are always welcome. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. For us this amounts to: We neither space for nazis, nor racism, sexism or other forms of inhumane behavior.
"Participation", can include according to our understand at least the following: using free networks and operating nodes one's self, socially connecting in local communities, being active in the local or supra-regional Freifunk community with his own abilities. Participation is not limited to technical abilities. Every form or engagement are explicitly welcome and are seen as contributions to the community.
We are aware that questions of power arise in our communities: power, attribution of power and exercise of power are made easier by centralized social as well as centralized technological structures. This is one of the reasons why we word according to the principle of decentrality. Also questions of power can be related to unequally distributed technical expertise. It is important for us to deal responsibly with this matter and to address and - where it is possible - reduce questions of power. We would like to achieve this through maximum knowledge transfer and decentralized structures.

### Proper handling of information and knowledge

We want to learn to build and operate networks instead of having them set up and maintained by "experts". We call that "do it yourself network". We would like to empower and encourage people to actively engage in the creation of infrastructure and to research and design the impact of technology on society. We promote the understanding of networks and network technology ("Network/Code Literacy"), therefore we pass on knowledge at any time and make the code publicly available. We research and experiment with infrastructure, therefore we do not have aspirations for permanent availability. Creation of "do it yourself" networks is a process. We are aware that this process does not attain every goal always at the same time. Therefore we regularly reflect critically without hostility. We give priority to learning and improvement of social and technological structures.

### Forms of organization

A Freifunk-community is a loose affiliation of several individuals in the best case. Local associations can support the group for example when collecting donations or when signing contracts. Founding an own association is no precondition for freifunk. Changes are jointly decided about by all active participants, not only by all members of providers or associations.
For the few community-overlapping decisions we establish "Freifunk Advisory Council", a representation of community-members of the different federal states. This council can be called in when there are conflicts between communities.
